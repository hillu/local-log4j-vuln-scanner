# Simple local log4j vulnerability scanner

(Written in Go because, you know, "write once, run anywhere.")

This is a simple tool that can be used to find vulnerable instances of 
log4j 1.x and 2.x (CVE-2019-17571, CVE-2021-44228, CVE-2021-45105, 
CVE-2021-44832) in installations of Java software such as web applications. 
JAR and WAR archives are inspected and class files that are known to be 
vulnerable are flagged. The scan happens recursively: WAR files containing 
WAR files containing JAR files containing vulnerable class files ought 
to be flagged properly.

The scan tool currently checks for known build artifacts that have
been obtained through Maven. From-source rebuilds as they are done for
Linux distributions may not be recognized.

Also included is a simple patch tool that can be used to patch out bad
classes from JAR files by rewriting the ZIP archive structure.

Binaries for x86_64 Windows, Linux, MacOSX for tagged releases are
provided via the
[Releases](https://github.com/hillu/local-log4j-vuln-scanner/releases)
page.

# Using the scanner

```
$ ./local-log4j-vuln-scanner [-verbose] [-quiet] [-ignore-v1] \
    [-exclude /path/to/exclude …] [-log /path/to/file.log] \
    /path/to/app1 /path/to/app2 …
```

The `-verbose` flag will show every .jar and .war file checked, even if no problem is found.

The `-quiet` flag will supress output except for indicators of a known vulnerability.

The `-ignore-v1` flag will _exclude_ checks for log4j 1.x vulnerabilities.

The `-log` flag allows everythig to be written to a log file instead of stdout/stderr.

Use the `-exclude` flag to exclude subdirectories from being scanned. Can be used multiple times.

If class files indicating one of the vulnerabilities are found,
messages like the following are printed to standard output:
``` console
./local-log4j-vuln-scanner - a simple local log4j vulnerability scanner

indicator for vulnerable component found in /path/to/vuln/log4shell-vulnerable-app-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.war::WEB-INF/lib/log4j-core-2.14.1.jar (org/apache/logging/log4j/core/net/JndiManager$JndiManagerFactory.class): log4j 2.14.0-2.14.1

# Using the patch tool

**Caution:** Use this at your own risk and keep the original JAR files.
```
$ ./local-log4j-vuln-patcher log4j-core-2.14.1.jar log4j-core-2.14.1-patched.jar
Filtering out org/apache/logging/log4j/core/pattern/MessagePatternConverter.class (log4j 2.14)
Filtering out org/apache/logging/log4j/core/net/JndiManager.class (log4j 2.14.0-2.14.1)

Writing to log4j-core-2.14.1-patched.jar done
```

# Building from source

Install a [Go compiler](https://golang.org/dl).

Run the following commands in the checked-out repository:
```
go build -o local-log4j-vuln-scanner ./scanner
go build -o local-log4j-vuln-patcher ./patcher
```
(Add the appropriate `.exe` extension on Windows systems, of course.)
